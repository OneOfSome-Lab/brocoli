# kcesar.py.- In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is an ancient form of substitution cipher. 
# It is named in the honor of Roman emperor, Julius Caesar. It was in use till 1916, the Russian Army 
# used it during the I GW. Traditionaly the key is 3, and just characters 
# with this software the key could be from 1  to 46  instead 1 to 26
# and you can use numbers and others characters.
